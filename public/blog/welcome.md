Welcome to Sado Space - open-source tools &amp; services supporting [Ordinals](https://docs.ordinals.com/).

## About

What started as an open protocol designed to facilitate decentralized marketplaces has evolved into a full-stack of ordinal-aware blockchain infrastructure. From the IPFS pining services we have developed for handling the SADO global order-books, through to our UTXO parser and API, which communicate with our forked [ORD](https://github.com/sadoprotocol/ord) servers. 

We have also developed the ORDIT SDK, which not only acts as middleware to ensure that all browser extension wallets behave in the same way, but it also has its own wallet-class to enable trustless inscriptions and more. In addition to this, we have also published several [Ordinal Improvement Proposals](https://www.oips.io/).
