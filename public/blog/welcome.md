Welcome to Sado Space - the independent research lab sponsored by [Ordzaar](https://ordzaar.com). We provide a collection of open-source tools, protocols and services to help support bitcoin ordinals.

What started as an open protocol designed to facilitate decentralized marketplaces has evolved into a full-stack of ordinal-aware blockchain infrastructure. From the [IPFS](https://sado.space/docs/ipfs-introduction) pining services we have developed for handling the [SADO](https://sado.space/docs/sdk-introduction) global order-books, through to our UTXO [parser](https://github.com/sadoprotocol/utxo-parser) and [API](https://github.com/sadoprotocol/utxo-api), which communicate with our forked [ORD](https://github.com/sadoprotocol/ord) servers. We have also developed the [ORDIT](https://sado.space/docs/ordit-introduction) SDK, which not only act as middleware to ensure that all browser extension wallets behave in the same way, but it also has its own wallet-class to enable trustless inscriptions and more.

In addition to this, we have also published several [Ordinal Improvement Proposals](https://www.oips.io/).


## Open

Sado is a protocol and the open-source implementation is designed to enable the trustless trading of Ordinals on any supported blockchain. This removes the need for centralized marketplaces.

## Efficient

Orders are created at fixed, affordable rates through the utilization of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store orders whilst only needing to relay the corresponding CID to the blockchain.

## Extendable

Sado can be extended easily to store additional metadata and/or media content by having fixed pricing regardless of the file size of the order.
