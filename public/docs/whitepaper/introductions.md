description: A protocol for selling, buying and trading Ordinals on the bitcoin network.

Ordinal Theory has been around since 1883. It is a form of mathematical notation used to describe infinite sets of numbers. However, it was only in 2023 that it was applied to Bitcoin as a way of tracking individual satoshis, the lowest denomination of Bitcoin. Ordinal Theory gives satoshis individual identities and allows them to be tracked by linking them to data that is permanently stored on the blockchain within segregated-witness scripts.

Although the ORD server is relatively infant and only recently available to the public, Casey Rodarmor who started the project has been working behind the scenes on Ordinal Theory and its application to Bitcoin for some time. His terminology and explanations regarding these theories and how they create a sense of rarity for each individual satoshi is quite extensive whilst also drawing parallels to archeology and even astrology when discussing the “cycles” that occurs every 24 years when the same block is used for both halving and difficult adjustments. The first satoshi found within one of those blocks is considered one of only five legendary Ordinals.

Ordinals on their own have no resemblance to NFTs. Although clearly inspired by them in some way, Rodarmor has expressed that he is not a fan of their lack of immutability and heavy reliance on InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which provides no guarantee of future availability in the same way that Bitcoin inscriptions do.

When creating a new Ordinal, the full inscription data is stored within segregated-witness scripts that become permanently available. Thus, instead of NFTs, Ordinals are viewed as digital artifacts. In the context of cryptocurrencies, digital artifacts refer to digital records and data inscribed to an individual satoshi on the Bitcoin blockchain as a transaction on the network.

Inscriptions on Bitcoin are true digital artifacts because they are immutable and tracked on the oldest, most decentralized, and most secure blockchain. In contrast to NFTs on other blockchains (such as Ethereum or Solana), inscriptions cannot be modified post-creation and are not plagued by off-chain data storage or smart contract audits.

When transferring a digital artifact, you are in fact only transferring an Ordinal - however, if you trace the lineage of that Ordinal, you will eventually find the original inscription containing the data or media.

In the project roadmap, Rodarmor outlines this problem of provenance as one of two issues preventing this technology from going mainstream.

The other problem he states that needs to be fixed is the ability to perform trustless trades with others on the same network. It is this problem that the SADO protocol is attempting to address, and it does so through the use of IPFS.

The IPFS is a mesh network of addressable content that is by default transient and extremely useful in cases such as shared orderbooks for trading.
