The objective of these specifications is to provide a flexible protocol that can enable multiple use-cases as efficiently as possible whilst removing the need for centralized third-parties and also providing enough core functionality to allow for more easily added future improvements.

The initial protocol will focus on four generic use cases:

 - [Making Sell Orders](/docs/making-sell-orders)
 - [Making Buy Orders](/docs/making-buy-orders)
 - [Taking Sell Orders](/docs/taking-sell-orders)
 - [Taking Buy Orders](/docs/taking-buy-orders)
