description: A protocol for selling, buying and trading Ordinals on the bitcoin network.

Ordinals as a mathematical concept for notation are not new. However, using them to identify and track individual satoshis for the transportation of digital artifacts on the Bitcoin blockchain is a relatively new craze. At present, the majority of trade is tracked in a Google spreadsheet. Despite the trustless nature of blockchain technology, the seamless trading of Ordinals between two unknown entities without the involvement of third-party arbitration and/or services has proven to be elusive.

By utilizing a content-addressable decentralized data storage method, it is possible to broadcast and fulfill self-authenticating orders to buy or sell Ordinals at specific prices. This can be done without needing to involve any third-parties for anything other than relaying signed transactions.
