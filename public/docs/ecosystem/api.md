The SADO API, an open-source server solution, facilitates interaction with the multitude of ecosystem services that the protocol utilizes to manage state between the Bitcoin Network and IPFS. We aim to provide developers with an extensive list of endpoints for seamless interaction with any operations related to the SADO protocol.

We are currently in a phase of intensive and active development of the API. Our team is dedicated to enhancing its functionality and features, aiming to further simplify operations against the SADO protocol, Bitcoin, and IPFS. As we progress, we will continue to augment the API, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We greatly appreciate your patience and support during this exciting period of expansion and enhancement.
