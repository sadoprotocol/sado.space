pageTitle: SADO - Self-Authenticating Decentralized Orderbooks
description: A protocol for selling, buying and trading Ordinals on the bitcoin network.
---

SADO has a default global orderbook. It also supports alternative orderbooks, allowing other users to operate their own private orderbook if required. Whether you want to study our protocol, use our tools to search for Ordinals and inscriptions, or trade digital artifacts. SADO space has you covered.

## Open

SADO is a protocol and the open-source implementation is designed to enable the trustless trading of Ordinals on any supported blockchain. This removes the need for centralized marketplaces.

## Efficient

Orders are created at fixed, affordable rates through the utilization of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store orders whilst only needing to relay the corresponding CID to the blockchain.

## Extendable

SADO can be extended easily to store additional metadata and/or media content by having fixed pricing regardless of the file size of the order.
