Our primary objective in the development of our SDK is to facilitate seamless interaction with services that utilize the Sado Protocol on the bitcoin network. We endeavor to make this experience as intuitive and straightforward as possible for all developers. To this end, we are diligently working on a JavaScript SDK and a CLI interface that will provide a simple yet effective means of interfacing with Sado compliant API endpoints. This will ensure that the information you require is readily accessible and easily retrievable.

At present, we are in the initial stages of active development. As our features and functionality evolve and expand, so too will our documentation. Our commitment is to provide a comprehensive and centralized source of information that developers can easily access and learn from. We appreciate your patience and support during this stage of growth and look forward to providing you with a robust and user-friendly solution.
